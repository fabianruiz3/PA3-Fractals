## PA3-Fractals
Welcome to the PA3-Fractals repository! This repository contains a fractal system that allows you to explore and visualize various fractal patterns. 
It was developed as part of the Programming Assignment for the Advanced Programming Course (CIIC4010) at UPRM.

## Setup
1. Clone this project inside an OpenFrameworks installation's "apps/myApps/" directory
   
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
   
3. Run the following command to compile the program:
```make```

4. Once the compilation is complete, run the following command to execute the program:
```make run```


## Fractals
To change between different fractals in the system, you can use the following number keys:

- Press <kbd>1</kbd> to switch to the Circle fractal.
- Press <kbd>2</kbd> to switch to the Tree fractal.
- Press <kbd>3</kbd> to switch to the Sierpinski Triangle fractal.
- Press <kbd>4</kbd> to switch to the Barnsley Fern fractal.
- Press <kbd>5</kbd> to switch to the Koch Snowflake fractal.
- Press <kbd>6</kbd> to switch to the Rectangle fractal.
- Press <kbd>7</kbd> to switch to the 3D Pyramid fractal.

## Features

The fractal system in this repository offers the following features:

- Control Depth: You can control a fractal's recursion depth using <kbd>left arrow</kbd> to decrease the depth and <kbd>right arrow</kbd> to increase the depth.
 
- Colorful Levels: Each level of a fractal is drawn in a different color. As you increase the depth, the colors change, providing a visually appealing representation of the recursive layers.
 
- Animation Feature: The system includes an animation feature that can be activated by pressing <kbd>space</kbd>. The fractal starts with a recursion depth of 1 and gradually increases the depth over time, creating a mesmerizing growth effect. Once it reaches its maximum depth, it reverses the process and returns to a depth 1. This animation cycle continues until <kbd>space</kbd> is pressed again, allowing you to enjoy the dynamic evolution of the fractal patterns.
 
- Camera Control: Hold <kbd>left-click</kbd> and drag the mouse to rotate the fractal. Hold <kbd>right-click</kbd> and drag the mouse to zoom into or out of the fractal. Only for 3D Pyramid fractal.
